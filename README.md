# SiboRocAdventure

A gift to **rocsorc...**

**rocsorc** and I have played a lot of Minecraft together and this
is an attempt to make a mod for him to enjoy with his gang.

It's my way of saying thank you for being my partner in Minecraft!

## TODO

A Lot..  

*  Framework for the mod + potential library
   * maven repo
   * slice up the library and mod-functionality
   * stick with 1.15.x for now.
*  Get a basic ore-block-item to work
   * An ore
   * A block derived
   * An item derived
*  A new biome.
   * Try out a way to establish a mod-specific biome
   * Certain requirements may fall out from this.
*  Populate the Biome(s) with the new stuff
   * Make the Ore and Natural occuring things occur only in this biome.
*  Recipes
   * The Horror...
*  Particle system
   * Fancy stuff, rendering, all sorts of UX excitement.
*  Back to the items/blocks.. fill out the millieu.
   * Make it all synchronize in a meaningful way.
   * What's the point
